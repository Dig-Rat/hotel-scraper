# Script: setup-cron-system.sh
# Purpose: Create a cron job file in /etc/cron.d
# NOTE: This version must be run with sudo/root because /etc/cron.d is system-owned.

# This version is better for system administration, 
# because jobs live in a file (/etc/cron.d/hotel_scraper) 
# instead of being tied to a specific userâ€™s hidden crontab.
# ===========================

# Variables
USER_NAME="youruser" # replace with username to run job as.

LOG_PATH="/home/$USER_NAME/hotel-scraper/log.txt"

# Format for /etc/cron.d is slightly different:
# -schedule
# -user the job runs as
# -command
# * * * * *     user command
#
# must include the username explicitly.
